# JATE-webpack-setup

## Description
Jate stands for Just Another Text Editor, and the deployed application is just that! My contributions to the project are focused on deployment, 
webpack setups, and client side asset caching to optimize page loading times. Additionally, the app has been refactored for full PWA functionality,
so it is available to download for offline usage.
